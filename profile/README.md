# JuliaCausality
**A common language for causality in Julia**

JuliaCausality is an organization dedicated to advancing causal inference tools and research in Julia with a focus on causal machine learning. We prioritize developing simple interfaces that other packages can implement so as to provide a common language for our users. In addition, we are phiosophy agnostic. In other words, we do not believe Frequentist, Bayesian, Potential Outcomes, Structural Causal Modeling, or any other framework to be superior to others. Rather, we develop interfaces for causal discovery, causal identification, and causal effect estimation and support developers of all philosophical leanings in building packages that implement our common verbiage.

## What Next?
- If you are interested in using Julia for causal modeling for your own projects, see our getting started guide.
- If you're interested in helping us with package development, see our contributing guidelines.
- If you have questions, see our slack, Zulip, or Discourse channels.
